            "The drop of 7.7mm and stack heights of 38.6mm and 30.9mm in the heel and forefoot, respectively, provide a comfortable balance between cushioning and responsiveness. This is especially beneficial during long-distance runs where cushioning is critical for reducing impact on the feet and joints. The shoe's design also features the ZoomX foam technology, which provides excellent energy return, allowing for a smooth and effortless stride.\n" +
